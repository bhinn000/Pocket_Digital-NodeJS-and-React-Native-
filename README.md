This is a system developed using React Native , NodeJs , MongoDB , VS code , Postman. Basically , the idea is to control the expenses (daily/monthly) for which there is system of maintaining the limit for each budget headings . You have to make payment for that headings within that range only.
For registration, we assume that you actually have bank account in real bank (for demo , we have used concept of mainBankID and added data through postman) and using that bank account(demo) , you can register in 'Pocket Digital'.
In this system , you can maintain limits for 3 different sector of expenses , logout , delete accout , view transaction history and summary.

For now , there is no code for admin and transaction history added , will done that in 2 to 3 days.
To know about this system , kindly check note.md in backend folder.There is in detail.

Thank you!
